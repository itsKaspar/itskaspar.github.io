Before 2021, to determine which site should be bombed, analysts would gather and process intelligence data beforehand. After investigation, they would pass on target locations to soldiers on the field. Working jointly, a group of analysts might suggest 50 sites a year1. But the lack of targets isnâ€™t always an opportunity to stop bombing. During the 2014 Gaza war, an investigation stated that the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) ran out of targets to bomb, but instead of stopping they decided to maintain pressure by bombing the same places multiple times, justifying the continuation of the war2.
